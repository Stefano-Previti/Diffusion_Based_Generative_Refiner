- ## Overview of the project
  
First the training of a diffusion-based generative model on clean speech data. After obtaining results from an arbitrary preceding SE module, the variance of the noise included in noisy input at each time-frequency bin is estimated. With the estimate, the proposed refiner generates clean speech on the basis of the DDRM framework, which utilizes the pre-trained diffusion-based model.
